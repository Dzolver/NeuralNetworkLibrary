# NeuralNetworkLibrary
This repository is my personal collection of AI model implementations on open source data. The listed folders contain models and data that have been infered from existing repositories and forums as part of a personal learning process. This collection is to serve as my baseline for reference when attempting challenges and tackling work tasks. I plan to update this repository with all the models that I can find, as long as they are implementable by PyTorch and feasible to run on my local machine. Otherwise the corresponding folders will contain documentation instead.
